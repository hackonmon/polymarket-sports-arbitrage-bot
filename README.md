## Why Open Source?

This repository is **not a commercial product**.

It exists for one reason:

> **To share a real working trading system instead of publishing endless AI-generated articles that provide no practical value.**

There are thousands of blog posts explaining arbitrage.

Very few people actually build one.

This project is my attempt to bridge that gap.

Everything inside this repository comes from building, testing, breaking, and rebuilding real trading infrastructure.

### A Few Honest Notes

This bot **will not magically print money.**

I don't hide that.

Markets evolve.

Edges disappear.

Liquidity changes.

Competition increases.

This repository is **a foundation**, not a guaranteed income machine.

However, it contains many of the engineering ideas, mathematical models, and architecture that I used before becoming consistently profitable.

If you're interested in quantitative trading, prediction markets, market microstructure, or TypeScript architecture, I hope you'll learn something useful.

### Trading is Mathematics

While building this project I also created:

**STAKE-MATH**

A Node.js library implementing Kelly-based stake sizing and probability mathematics.

Trading is not gambling.

Trading is probability management.

Without mathematics, risk management becomes guessing.

Many of the position sizing models used here are based on the Kelly Criterion, fractional Kelly, expected value, and bankroll optimization.

Those mathematical foundations have been responsible for far more of my long-term success than any individual trading strategy.

### My Recommendation

If you decide to experiment with this project:

- start with simulation mode
- understand every trade the bot makes
- test your own ideas
- use small position sizes
- never risk money you cannot afford to lose

Happy Trading ❤️

# Strategy

Sports markets inside a single event should satisfy several no-arbitrage relationships.

Whenever one market reprices faster than another after new information arrives, temporary inefficiencies can appear.

The bot continuously:

```
Gamma API
      │
      ▼
Discover connected markets
      │
      ▼
Stream live CLOB orderbooks
      │
      ▼
Detect pricing violations
      │
      ▼
Risk evaluation
      │
      ▼
Kelly stake sizing
      │
      ▼
Submit limit orders
      │
      ▼
Track positions & PnL
```

Current arbitrage checks include:

- Complementary YES/NO pairs
- Totals ladder relationships
- Spread ladder relationships
- Moneyline vs Spread
- Three-way market sums
- BTTS relationships

# Supported Sports

By default the bot focuses on the markets where liquidity is strongest.

| Sport | Markets |
|--------|----------|
| 🏀 NBA | Games, Futures, Draft, Trades, Props |
| ⚽ FIFA World Cup | Match Winner, Groups, Knockout, Tournament Winner |

```
SPORT_FOCUS=nba,world_cup
```

Discovery logs look like:

```
Discovery refresh:

40 events
520 tokens

NBA: 10
World Cup: 30
```

Adding another sport only requires creating another profile inside

```
src/model/sportsRegistry.ts
```

Logs are written separately using **Pino** so they never corrupt the dashboard.

# Configuration

See `.env.example`.

Important variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| MODE | sim | sim or live |
| MIN_NET_EDGE_BPS | 50 | Minimum edge |
| MAX_POSITION_USD | 500 | Max Kelly stake |
| KELLY_FRACTION | 0.5 | Half Kelly |
| MIN_STAKE_USD | 5 | Minimum trade |
| MAX_EVENT_EXPOSURE_USD | 200 | Event exposure cap |
| DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD | 100 | Kill switch |
| SIM_INITIAL_BALANCE | 10000 | Paper balance |

# Kelly Stake Sizing

The project sizes positions using the Kelly Criterion.

```
f* = (p − price)
     ───────────
      (1-price)
```

```
stake = bankroll
      × Kelly
      × Fractional Kelly
```

Position sizes are automatically clamped between:

- Minimum stake
- Maximum position
- Event exposure limits

Supported for:

- Locked arbitrage
- Relative value
- Hedged ladder trades

Default configuration uses **Half Kelly (0.5)** to reduce variance.

```

# Live Trading

Live mode requires:

```
PRIVATE_KEY

CLOB_API_KEY

CLOB_API_SECRET

CLOB_API_PASSPHRASE
```

and either

```
--confirm-live
```

or

```
CONFIRM_LIVE=true
```

Execution uses

```
@polymarket/clob-client-v2
```

against production endpoints.
